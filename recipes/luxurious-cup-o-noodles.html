    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>
        <strong>Bored of ordinary instant ramen?</strong><br>
        Turn cup of noodles into a complete meal by adding eggs, vegetables,<br>
        and protein for a quick and portable meal in less than 10 minutes.<br> 
        This recipe doesn't require a stove â€” the microwave does all the cooking.</p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>50g Cabbage</li>
            <li>50g Carrot</li>
            <li>15g Onion</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>30g Ham</li>
            <li>1 Cup of Noodles</li>
            <li>3 Leaves Basil</li>
            <li>1 pinch sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop and slice the protein (meat, tofu, etc.) and vegetables (cabbage, carrot, lettuce, etc.) that you want to add to your noodles.</li>
            <li>Open the lid halfway on the cup of noodles. Remove the seasoning packet from the cup. Crack the eggs into your cup of noodles. Discard the shells.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced vegetables that benefit from cooking into the noodle cup.</li>
            <li>Add as much of the seasoning as you like to your cup of noodles. Zap the cup of noodles in the microwave for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Once the cup of noodles is out of the microwave, add boiling water up to the line specified in the cup.</li>
            <li>Replace the lid over the cup. Put a plate or other flat object over the mouth of the cup to seal in the heat.</li>
            <li>While you're waiting for the boiling water to do its magic, assemble your garnishes.</li>
            <li>Once the timer goes off, the noodles are ready to eat.</li>
        </ol>
